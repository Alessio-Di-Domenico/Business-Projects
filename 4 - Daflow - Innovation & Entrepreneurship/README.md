The proposal suggests creating a platform for Gen Z individuals and ethical startups to collaborate on noble initiatives. Gen Z users can securely share their data, knowing how it will be used, and receive rewards. Ethical startups benefit from affordable access to quality data, enabling better decisions and innovation. The platform fosters trust and cooperation, building a community focused on responsible data use for societal and environmental improvement.
